<h1>THE HISTORY OF LIMA</h1>

<h2>Pre-Columbian and colonial periods</h2>
<img src="images/colonial.png" alt="government">
<p>The area around Lima has been inhabited for thousands of years. Urban communities of significant size date from the pre-Inca Early Intermediate Period (c. 200 BCE–600 CE), the most important being Pachacamac, which was an important religious site in both pre-Inca and Inca times. Much of the ransom demanded by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro for the Inca chief Atahuallpa (Atahualpa) was obtained</p>

<p>The Spanish city of Lima was founded by Pizarro on Jan. 18, 1535, as the Ciudad de los Reyes (“City of the Kings”). Although the name never stuck, Lima soon became the capital of the new Viceroyalty of Peru, chosen over the old Inca capital of Cuzco to the southeast because the coastal location facilitated communication with Spain.</p>

<p>Lima developed into the centre of wealth and power for the entire viceroyalty: as the seat of the audiencia (high court), it administered royal justice; and, being the headquarters in the viceroyalty of the Inquisition, it pronounced on religious and moral matters. It also became the site of Peru’s most prestigious associations and centres of learning, including the University of San Marcos (1551), the Peruvian Academy of Letters (1887), the National University of Engineering (1896), and the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (1917). José Hipólito Unnúe founded a medical school there in 1808.</p>

<p>From the late 17th to the mid-19th century, however, Lima grew extremely slowly in both area and population. The city was devastated by a powerful earthquake in 1746. Although it was rebuilt in grandiose fashion, influenced heavily by the European Enlightenment, it remained politically conservative and socially stratified. Lima maintained its loyalty during the struggles for Latin American independence in the early 19th century, with Peru becoming the last mainland colony to declare its independence from Spain (July 1821).</p>

<h2>The modern city</h2>
<img src="images/modern.png" alt="government">
<p>Lima’s development into a modern city began after the completion of the Lima-Callao railroad in 1851. Interurban railway links to Miraflores, Ancón, and Chosica followed in the next 20 years and provided the opportunity for suburban growth. The small, compact, pedestrian city gradually lost its wealthier residents, who physically distanced themselves from the lower classes by building mansions in and around Miraflores. Also during that period, Lima and Callao benefited from a boom in exports of nitrate-rich guano deposits, which were collected from islands off the Peruvian coast and shipped to Europe. However, Lima’s prosperity subsequently declined as political turmoil swept the country, and, as a result of the disastrous War</p>

<p>Despite the loss of the library, the city’s literary scene experienced a rebirth with Ricardo Palma’s series of colonial legends and stories called Tradiciones Peruanas (“Peruvian Traditions”), which appeared between 1872 and 1910. Influential literary figures of the early 20th century included the leftist political leader and essayist José Carlos Mariátegui and the poets César Vallejo, José María Eguren, and José Santos Chocano; although many of their works focused on events outside of Lima (e.g., the plight of rural Indians), they exerted a profound influence on the intelligentsia of the city and, by extension, the country.</p>
<p>A new wave of urban expansion in the 1920s and ’30s was set off by the automobile and the subsequent road-building program that improved transportation not only within the capital but also between Lima and other parts of the country. For the first time, migrants could reach Lima relatively easily, and this rich, powerful, and modernizing centre became a national magnet. The consequences for Lima were drastic. From 1940 to 1980 some 2,000,000 people moved to the city. Hundreds of thousands of shanties were constructed on the bare, unoccupied slopes that rose above the red-tiled roofs of the inner suburbs and on the flat desert benches that encircled Lima. Individual acts of occupying unused and unclaimed pieces of land gave way to well-planned “invasions” involving many hundreds of new city residents. So enormous became the numbers of the self-help housing units that the government finally yielded to the residents’ initiatives, awarding titles to the land and trying to provide basic services. Roughly one-third of metropolitan residents lived in pueblos jóvenes by 1990. A system of multilane expressways was built in the late 20th century to serve the city’s expanding population, which had surpassed 7,000,000 by the early 21st century.

Lima continues to influence nearly every facet of Peruvian national life—economic, political, and cultural. Since the mid-20th century, some of the more renowned works of novelist Mario Vargas Llosa have been set in Lima, including La ciudad y los perros (1963; “The City and the Dogs”; Eng. trans. The Time of the Hero) and La tía Julia y el escribidor (1977; “Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter”). Among the more recent works focusing on Lima are Julio Ramón Ribeyro’s tragicomic stories and Jaime Bayly’s Yo amo a mi mami (1999; “I Love My Mom”), relating the experiences of a suburban child raised by household servants.</p>
<p>The city’s historic centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988; in 1991 the site was redefined to include the former convent of San Francisco. However, Lima’s historic buildings are threatened by elevated levels of air pollution from automobiles and buses and by earthquakes (the largest to ravage Lima occurred in 1746, killing 5,000 people) and other hazards (such as a fire that destroyed the ornate municipal theatre in 1998). In the 1990s many of Lima’s antique wooden balconies were repaired and restored.</p>

<h1>LIMA'S ECONOMY</h1>

<h2>Economic Overview of Lima</h2>
<img src="images/overview.png" alt="government">
<p>The Peruvian economy, which is the seventh largest in Latin America, has experienced a structural change in the past three decades. Currently, the services sector is the main contributor to the country’s GDP, with nearly 60% of GDP stemming from this sector. Telecommunications and financial services are the main branches of the services sector; together they account for nearly 40% of GDP. However, the country still has a long way to go toward the modernization and competitiveness of its service sectors. Industry, which represents around 35% of GDP, has undergone a process of modernization, which has translated into increased employment in the country’s primary industrial areas.</p>
<p>Since GDP decelerated sharply in 2009, the economy has built on solid growth fundamentals. Domestic demand has been the main driver of growth as an overall improvement in confidence in the economy has boosted domestic consumption and investment. Moreover, the steady fiscal consolidation that led to a number of budget surpluses in the past decade has increased confidence in public finances and allowed for productive public expenditures. A period of relatively stable inflation and the progressive appreciation of the national currency, the sol, have helped the economy overcome periods of nominal volatility. Although the external sector’s contribution to economic growth has been diminishing, exports have remained strong. The main detraction from the external sector’s contribution to growth has stemmed from increasing imports, although capital goods imports have remained at healthy levels, which bodes well for the country’s productive capacity, economic growth and employment in the coming years.</p>
<p>The combination of economic modernization, natural resource abundance and continued improvements in economic governance and political stability that have been taking place, are helping Peru to emerge as one of the most stable economies in Latin America.

</p>
<h2>Lima Economic History

</h2>
<img src="images/history.png" alt="government">
<p>Like many Latin American countries, Peru underwent an intentional process of state-driven industrialization in the mid-twentieth century, yet the country did not emerge from this period with a competitive industrial fabric. In the 1980s, Peru and its counterparts in the region were strongly impacted by the regional debt crisis. The crisis, accompanied by strong political divisions and internal armed conflicts, prompted the country to ask for an intervention by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1988.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, under the rule of Alberto Fujimori and backed by the strong performance of government investment and inflows of foreign direct investment, the country pursued sharp fiscal consolidation policies and structural and institutional reforms in order to halt the inflationary process that took place after the debt crisis. However, it was not until the 2000s that political stability and democratic progress came about. Nonetheless, institutional transparency was still fraught with several corruption cases during this period.

</p>
<p>In the last decade, under the last two presidents Alan García (2006-2011) and Ollanta Humala (2011–2016), economic activity has benefited from a favorable international context, particularly from improving terms of trade. The expansion in economic activity has substantially increased the State’s resources, prompted social cohesion policies and paved the way for more public investment projects. Moreover, the expansion of the external sector has continued to provide increased resources to the Peruvian state, which, in turn, have allowed the country to find a balanced path of growth with increased social inclusion.</p>
<h2>Limas’s Balance of Payments</h2>
<img src="images/balance.png" alt="government">
<p>

In the last decade, Peru has changed its external position from being a net international creditor to a net debtor. However, its external position remains solid. After registering surpluses between 2004 and 2007, the current account balance has accumulated deficits since then. This change has come on the back of the progressive narrowing of the trade balance surpluses that had been in place since 2002. Whereas the service and the factor income balances have been broadly stable, the transfers’ balance—which mainly accounts for international remittances—has remained in surplus, although it has been narrowing in the last years.</p>
<p>The corresponding capital inflows benefit from a strong contribution from Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which has performed strongly in the last decade with a record of USD 12.2 billion inflows in 2012. Among the countries that invest the most in Peru are Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Nearly a quarter of the total FDI is attracted by the mining sector and nearly the half of it is split among the financial, communications and industry sectors.</p>

<h2>Peru’s Trade Structure</h2>
<img src="images/trade.png" alt="government">
<p>Despite the progressive improvement of internal demand, the external sector’s performance continues to be of crucial importance to the Peruvian economy. As a country rich in natural resources, it exports goods that are highly subject to price volatility, whereas it imports industrial goods, prices of which are less volatile. Therefore, Peru’s external position remains vulnerable to changes in the terms of trade (i.e., the relative price of exports over the price of imports). The country has benefited from a steady improvement in its terms of trade since 2000, which helped keep the trade balance in positive figures up until 2013. The trade balance peaked at a record-high surplus of USD 9.8 billion in February 2012. It has narrowed uninterruptedly since then and shifted to deficit in December 2013. This trend has been driven by falling global demand and decreasing prices for traditional Peruvian exports, such as copper, silver and natural gas. The increase in import volumes has also affected the trade balance negatively.

</p>
<p>In Peru, ores and minerals exports make up over 50% of total exports, food accounts for 21% and mineral fuels account for 12%. As in many resource-rich countries with a traditional export-led growth model, international trade and financial conditions have largely affected the performance of the external sector. In fact, the economy as a whole has been affected by these conditions, even considering that domestic demand has been the main driver of growth in recent years.</p>
<p>Due to favorable conditions in international trade, the country has experienced average annual growth in real goods and services exports of 5.5% since 2000. That said, in the same period, imports have expanded at an average 8.0% annually, thus outpacing the strong performance in exports. In nominal terms, imports now exceed exports, which caused 2014 and 2015 to close with trade balance deficits after 11 years of recording surpluses.

<h1>THE GEOGRAPHY OF LIMA</h1>
<img src="images/geography.png" alt="government">
<p>Lima geography is dominated by its location. Stretched on a mostly flat terrain in the Peruvian coastal plain, caught between the Pacific Ocean and the beginning slopes of the Andes, already rising to 500 meter above sea level within the city boundaries, Lima nevertheless is a desert city.  Being the second biggest desert city in the world, after Cairo Egypt, apart from the typical plains within Lima geography exist isolated hills which are not connected to the surrounding hill chains of the beginning Andes. The San Cristobal hill, one of the most outstanding in the Lima geography, located in the Rimac district, which faces directly north of the downtown area, is the local extreme of an Andean hill outgrowth</p>
<p>Metropolitan Lima has an area of 2,672.28 km2. The urban area extends around 60 km from north to south and around 30 km from west to east. The city center is located 15 km inland at the shore of the Rimac river. While no official administrative definition for the city exists, it is usually considered to be composed of the central 30 out of the 43 districts of Lima Province, corresponding to an urban area centered around the historic Cercado de Lima district.</p>

<h1>LIMA'S GOVERNMENT</h1>

<h2>Constitutional framework</h2>
<img src="images/framework.png" alt="government">
<p>Peru’s political history has been punctuated by numerous military coups and changes of constitution. The 1993 Peruvian constitution, which has since been amended several times, decrees a government headed by a president who is popularly elected to a five-year term and serves as chief of state and head of government. The president can be reelected but is prohibited from serving consecutive terms. The president appoints and presides over the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) and is assisted by the president of the Council of Ministers (in effect, the prime minister, who is also appointed by the president) as well as by two popularly elected vice presidents. Legislative power is vested in the unicameral Congress of the Republic, whose members are popularly elected to five-year terms.</p>

<h2>Political process</h2>
<img src="images/process.png" alt="government">
<p>Voting is compulsory for all citizens ages 18–70. A wide spectrum of political parties—ranging from right-wing conservative to left-wing socialist and communist—participate in the political process, including the Nationalist Party United Peru (left-wing), the Peruvian Aprista Party (formerly left-wing but now moderate centre), and National Unity (right-wing). Traditional parties have been supplanted in many elections by hastily formed coalitions. For example, the winner of the 1990 presidential contest, Alberto Fujimori, created a new party expressly for that election. A law passed in 2003 requires that women constitute at least 30 percent of all candidates on party lists. In the early 21st century, women held slightly more than one-fourth of the seats in Congress.</p>

<h2>Local government</h2>
<img src="images/local.png" alt="government">
<p>For administrative purposes, the country is divided into 25 regions, which are further divided into departments, provinces, and districts. The regional level of government encompasses regions and departments; provinces, districts, and smaller population centres constitute the levels of local government.</p>

<h2>Justice</h2>
<img src="images/justice.png" alt="government">
<p>The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and lower courts and tribunals. The Supreme Court has nationwide jurisdiction and hears appeals from lower-court decisions; it also investigates the conduct of lower-court judges. All Supreme Court judges and some judges of lower courts are appointed by the National Council of the Magistracy. A Constitutional Court exists to review any challenges concerning the constitutionality of laws and acts of government. Members of the Constitutional Court are elected by Congress and serve five-year terms.</p>
